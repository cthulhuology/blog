Getting Started
---------------

Right now the code doesn't do anything, but you can run the tests:

	make test

And you can start a hello world server:

	./server 0.0.0.0 8080 ./http

This will take any HTTP request parse it and serve "hello world".

The http code will be more a library to include into other applications.
