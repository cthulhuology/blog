<h1>Title Goes Here</h1>
<p>
So Ghost has been treating me poorly the last few weeks. The monitoring I have crashes the node service every few days. Once swap fills up, the site grinds to a halt and dies a horrible death. Occasionally the server even needs a reboot just to get SSH to work. 
</p>
<li>process isolation - each client ran in their own process space</li>
<li>multiple engines - each port could be serviced by a different engine</li>
<li>non-blocking accept - port management would take advantage of epoll</li>
<li>zombie handling - child processes would be reaped efficiently</li>
<li>low overhead sockets - each child would own their own socket</li>
<p>Never mind that most of the traffic my blog currently gets is my own monitoring scripts, but it should be able to handle the strain of serving largely static content as well as anything, and definitely better than the nodejs app it is running right now.</p>
