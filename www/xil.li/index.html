<h1>xilli linux</h1>
<p>
xilli linux is a pragmatic linux distribution for everyday use. 

<i>xilli is pronounce like the english word chilly</i>

Designed with love, xilli linux removes many of the 
outdated technologies from the typical linux stack.

Our development objectives for xilli are that it be:

	* simple
	* understandable
	* manageable
	* and command-line friendly

</p>
<h2>Papers &amp; Sources</h2>

<p>
As xilli is currently under heavy development, it is
not recommended for daily use yet.  If you want to 
experiment with getting it running on your system you
can get all of the sources from <a href="https://github.com/cthulhuology/xilli">github</a>.
</p>

<p>
To checkout the source from git, the current public git mirror is:

	git clone https://github.com/cthulhuology/xilli.git
</p>

<p>
The README file has the most current instructions on how to
complie the base system.  Currently it is know to compile on
Debian Jessie and SteamOS brewmaster.  
</p>

<h3>xilli concepts</h3>
<p>
There are many aspects of xilli linux that are experimental, and
as such some of the concepts presented are different from other
linuxes you may be accustomed to.  First off, xilli doesn't follow
the FHS. Instead it uses the following:

</p>
<p>The key observations is that from a 3rd party software perspective,
/, /usr/, and /usr/local/ are equivalent.  Also, /home is root's
home directory (xilli is single user).  The source code to the system
is contained in /src, and all of the build tools are in /tools.
</p>
<p>Xilli eschews package management software.  Rather to install software
on xilly one types:
	
	/install/package-name

</p>
<p>This will build from source from the /src/ directory the package 
int the /tmp/ directory, and install it into /</p>

<p>Eventually, xilli will support:

	/uninstall/package-name
</p>
<p>But that is currently a rather low priority, as many useful 
programs are still not built for xilli, and much of the /src 
directory still doesn't have build scripts.  All of the build
instructions are just bash scripts, and are easily read, modified,
and understood by anyone.
